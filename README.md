# MVPs

As part of the 16 week coding course, [Founders & Coders](http://www.foundersandcoders.com) students undertake short - 1 _sprint_ (two week) - MVP builds.

This offering is [currently being debated further](https://github.com/dwyl/ateam-proposal/issues/37).

## Letter of Engagement
Each MVP client will need to sign a letter of engagement with Founders & Coders CIC to ensure that both the client and the dev team are very clear on what the terms of the sprint are.

[@iteles](http://www.github.com/iteles) has drawn up [an extremely simple example letter of engagement template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sLgxxNTZxnA3WaoLpTE53_ooS-iLzb7nN0ghQgPQSeo/edit?usp=sharing) that you can use with your clients.

#### Please don't alter this template directly.
Remember to copy the file to your _own_ Google Drive using _'File > Make a copy...'_ **before updating it**.
